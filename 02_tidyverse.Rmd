## Learning Goal
You can recognize tidy data and start using tidyverse tools to implement data science workflows.

## The package
We will use the `tidyverse` package many many times in this unit. You can install the package using the following statement.
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


After installation,  you can use the following command to expose functions from the package.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
As you can see, it actually loads several other packages.

### Piping
Tidyverse use the pipe `%>%` to help organise analysis steps.

When we apply a sequence of operations on a dataset, we can write:
```{r}
plot(density(iris$Sepal.Length))
```
That gives us a lot of parentheses and affects readability. 

With the pipe `%>%`, we can rewrite the operations in the same order of execution.
```{r}
iris$Sepal.Length %>%  #piping 
  density %>% 
  plot
```

> Rewrite the function call `max(head(iris$Petal.Width, n = 20))` with the pipe operator `%>%`.
```{r}
iris$Petal.Width %>% 
 head(n = 20) %>%  
 max
```



```{r}
iris$Petal.Width %>% 
 head(n = 20) %>%  
 max
```

## Tidy data


### Why tidy data
Tidy data provides a consistent starting point for your analysis, as shown in the following figure from  [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).

![Data science workflow based on tidyverse](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/571b056757d68e6df81a3e3853f54d3c76ad6efc/32d37/diagrams/data-science.png)


### How to recognise tidy data
According to Hadley, a tidy dataset satisfies the following three conditions:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

![Tidy data defined by Hadley](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)

We will talk more about tidy data later. For now, we will just start using tidyverse tools.

## Importing data

CSV is a common format for storing data. Let's load a csv file.
```{r}
heights <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/main/data/heights.csv")
head(heights)
```

You can see that the imported data is more than merely a data frame. These are called "tibbles" and it supports tidyverse operations. You can read more [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html).
```{r}
class(heights)
```

You can also see that categorical variables are parsed as the character type.
To change that, you can specify the column types when reading the file.
```{r}
heights <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/main/data/heights.csv",
                    col_types = cols(
                      sex = col_factor(levels = c("male", "female"))
                    ))
head(heights)
```


## Transforming data

### Adding or changing variables
Following the example above, often the default variable types are mostly good enough. You can create factor variables after the data is imported.
```{r}
heights1 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/main/data/heights.csv") %>% 
  mutate(sex = factor(sex),
         race = factor(race))
head(heights1)
```

Actually, you may do multiple conversions at once.


> Do the following two statements lead to different results?

```{r}
heights_1 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/main/data/heights.csv") %>% 
  mutate(sex = factor(sex),
         race =factor(race))
```

```{r}
heights_2 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/r4ds/main/data/heights.csv") %>% 
  mutate_if(is_character, factor)
```

> Read the documentation for the functions `mutate_all` and `mutate_at`. What can they do?


The `nycflights13` package contains a `flights` data frame. 
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
head(flights)
```


In the "flights" dataset, we see that the column `dep_delay` is the difference between `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time`. If the column is not provided, you can compute it as follows.
```{r}
flights <- flights %>% mutate(dep_delay2 = dep_time - sched_dep_time)
```

> Now try to create a new variable showing the arrival delay and compare it with `arr_delay`.



### Subsetting
How to select the relevant subsets from the original data?

#### Vertically: `select`
```{r}
flights %>% 
  dplyr::select(year, origin)
```
This is similar to the `SELECT` keyword in SQL.


#### Horizontally: `filter`
```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(origin == 'JFK')
```

This is similar to the `WHERE` keyword in SQL.

### Aggregation
dplyr provides the function `summarise` which has the most flexibility.
```{r}
flights %>% 
  summarise(shortest_air_time = min(air_time, na.rm = T), # remove during calculations instead of removing permanently from data with isnull
            longest_air_time = max(air_time, na.rm = T))
```

Do those numbers surprise you?


dplyr also provides many pre-made aggregation functions such as `n_distinct`.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  summarise(number_of_airport = n_distinct(origin), 
            max_delay = max(dep_delay, na.rm = T))
```




#### Group-wise aggregation
Aggregation gets interesting when it is done by groups.
```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(min_delay = min(dep_delay, na.rm = T),
            max_delay = max(dep_delay, na.rm = T))
```
```{r}
unique(flights$origin)
```

> Find out the number of carriers using each NYC airport.

```{r echo = FALSE}
flights %>% group_by(origin) %>% summarise(carrier_count = n_distinct(carrier))

```
```{r}
flights %>% group_by(origin) %>% summarise(carrier_count =  length(unique(flight)))
```

> Find out the number of flights in each airport and each month.

```{r echo=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, month) %>% 
  summarise(cnt = n())
```


### Merging data frames
You can merge two data frames.



```{r}
flights <- flights %>%
  left_join(
    (airports %>% 
       dplyr::select(faa, dest_airport = name)),
     by = c("dest" ="faa")
  )
```

> Modify the example above to use the `inner_join` function. How is the result different? 


```{r echo=FALSE}
flights <- flights %>%
  inner_join(
    (airports %>% 
       dplyr::select(faa, dest_airport = name)),
     by = c("dest" ="faa")
  )
```


That's the gist of tidyverse transformation tools. 


## More tasks:

Read in the weather data in the `nycflights` dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/nycflights13/master/data-raw/weather.csv . Then change the variable `origin` to have the factor data type. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
weather <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/nycflights13/master/data-raw/weather.csv") %>% mutate(origin = factor(origin))
```

Find out the list of carriers using each NYC airport 
```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(carrier_name = unique(carrier))
  #summarise(cnt = n())
```


Find out the number of destinations from each airport 
```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(num_dest = n_distinct(dest))
```


Find out the shortest and longest flight from each airport 

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(shortest_air_time = min(air_time, na.rm = T),
            longest_air_time = max(air_time, na.rm = T))
```

```{r}
flights <- flights %>%
  inner_join(
    (airports %>% 
       dplyr::select(faa, dest_airport = name)),
     by = c("dest" ="faa")
  )
```
