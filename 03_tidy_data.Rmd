## Learning Goal
1. You know how to use R to compute density or mass of common probability distributions and draw a 
random sample from the distribution to verify statistical properties.
2. You can convert untidy data into tidy data using 1) spreading, 2) gathering, 3) separating, and 4) uniting.


## R functions for distributions

R language provides a comprehensive set of tools for generating a random sample from a probability distribution. 
A set of distributions can be found https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Distributions.html .
For each distribution `XXX`, R provides a probability distribution function `pXXX`, a density functions `dXXX`, a quantile functions `qXXX`, and a random number generation function `rXXX`.
For example, the following functions are available for the Poisson distribution.
```{r eval=FALSE}
dpois(x=5, lambda=10, log = FALSE)
ppois(q, lambda, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
qpois(p, lambda, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
rpois(n, lambda)
```

Suppose that you have a Poisson distribution $p(k; \lambda) = \exp^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}$. 
The following call generate the density $p(50; 4)$.
```{r}
dpois(x = 50, lambda = 4)
```


What result do you get with the call below? Why?
```{r}
dpois(x = 1, lambda = 4)
```


To generate 100 random sample points from the above distribution, you can use the following function call.
```{r}
set.seed(42)
x <- rpois(10000000, lambda = 16)
#x
```

> What are the sample mean and the sample variance of x?
######to improve/stabilize output: increase sample size 


```{r echo=FALSE}
mean(x)
var(x)
```

> Repeat the experiment 50 times. Compare the generated mean and variance. Are they close?

```{r}
m = c()
v= c()
for (i in 1:500)
{
  set.seed(i)
  x=rpois(100000,lambda=16)
  m= c(m,mean(x))
  v=c(v,var(x))
}
mean(m-v)
var(m-v)
sd(m-v)
hist(m)
v
mean(m)
```


## Tidy data

Last week, we have learned how to recognise tidy data based on the following three criteria:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.


Given a dataset, it is helpful to ask the following questions.

- What are the variables?
- What is an observation?

When you answer "yes" to either of the following questions, most likely your data is untidy.

- Do you have values in the heading?
- Do you have variable names in a column?


In this practical, we will learn how to make your data tidy.

### Gather and spread to tidy data

Table 4 below has values (1999, 2000) in the heading; It is untidy. We can *gather* these values into a column (year).

Table 2 below has variable names ("cases", "population") in a column; It is untidy. We can *spread* these variable names into the heading.

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8350f0dda414629b9d6c354f87acf5c5f722be43/bcb84/images/tidy-8.png" width="110%">


> Read the documentation for the tidyverse functions *gather* and *spread* to understand how to use these two functions. You may also like to read Chapter 12 of [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).


Following [R4DS], we will tidy up the WHO 2014 TB incidence report.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
head(who)
who
```

> Find out the definition of each variables in the data dictionary provided (https://extranet.who.int/tme/generateCSV.asp?ds=dictionary).

Clearly we have variable names that correspond to combinations of some categorical variables. 
In other words, we have values in the heading. Hence we can use *gather* first. We also provide *pivot_longer* equivalent for *gather*.
Check the shapes of the outputs and how they are transformed.

```{r}
#gather
who

who1 <- who %>% 
  gather(key = "case_group", 
         value = "cases", 
         starts_with("new"),
         na.rm = TRUE)
who1

#pivot_longer
who_equivalent <- who %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "case_group",
              values_to = "cases",
              starts_with("new"))

#note that pivot_longer behaviour is somewhat different in sorting the output.

who_spread_back <- who1 %>% 
  spread(case_group, cases)

who_spread_back
#note: the size here differs from the original one because we removed na.rm = TRUE. If we hadn't (comment out to test), the size would be the same.


who_wider_back <- who_equivalent %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = case_group, values_from = cases)

who_wider_back

```

Here we decide to remove the NAs as a missing value likely represents no data in that group. 

> What should we do if we believe that an NA is equivalent to zero case count?

```{r echo=FALSE}
who1 <- who %>% 
  gather(key = "case_group", 
         value = "cases", 
         starts_with("new"), 
         na.rm = FALSE) %>% 
  replace_na(list(cases = 0))
who1
```


> Is *who1* tidy?

In the case_group column, each cell is a combination of three (for the "new and relapse" cases) or  four values (for the "new" cases). 
```{r}
who2 <- who1 %>% 
  separate(col = case_group, 
           into = c("new", "manifestation_gender_age"), 
           sep = "_",
           extra = "merge")
who2
```

> Read the documentation for the tidyverse function *separate* and understand what the argument "extra" does here.

Since the "new and relapse" cases do not have information on the disease manifestation, we will fill it with NA.

```{r}
who3 <- who2 %>% 
  separate(col = manifestation_gender_age,
           into = c("manifestation", "gender_age"),
           sep = "_",
           fill = "left")
who3
```

> What happens if we remove the "fill" argument?

Finally, we can separate the gender and the age group.

```{r}
who4 <-  who3 %>% 
  separate(col = "gender_age",
           into = c("gender", "age_group"),
           sep = 1)  #separate first character from left if -1 its one character from right
who4
```


> Look at *who4*. Is it tidy now?

Once we have a tidy data set, we can easily apply other tidyverse tools to analyse the data set.
```{r}
who4 %>% 
  filter(country == "Australia",
         new == "new") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases, color = gender)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_grid(age_group~manifestation)
```

We will come back to ggplot2 later in the unit.

### Your turn

1. Group the above steps into one statement using pipe.
2. Do all the variables have the correct types? If not, use "mutate" to convert them into the correct variable types. Make sure "age_group" has the variable type for an ordinal variable.
3. Download the climate statistics for the Melbourne Airport from the Bureau of Meteorology ( http://www.bom.gov.au/clim_data/cdio/tables/text/IDCJCM0035_086282.csv) Is the data tidy? If not, see if you can make it tidy.

### Summary

You can use *gather* and *spread* to obtain tidy data.

The strategies: 
 
* If data from the same measurement source are scattered in multiple columns, "gather" them into the same column 
* If data from the same observation are scattered in multiple rows, "spread" them into the same row
